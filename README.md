## Project 1 – Classification, weight sharing, auxiliary losses
## Project 2 – Mini deep-learning framework
The objective of this project is to design a mini “deep learning framework” using only pytorch’s
tensor operations and the standard math library, hence in particular without using autograd or the
neural-network modules.
